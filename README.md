# Digicert-Go-Challenge

# Instructions:

Using Go write a minimal web based REST API for a fictional public library that can perform the following functions:

    1. List all books in the library

    2. CRUD operations on a single book

The application does not have to be fully functional, but please take the time needed to exhibit your skills. There's no restrictions on what resources or third-party plugins you may use. We are looking for your best thoughts on application architecture, REST API design, maintainability, etc. Please return you submission as a link to a GitHub repo once completed. We look forward to seeing your results!
